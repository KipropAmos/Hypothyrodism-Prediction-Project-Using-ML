# Using machine learning to predict individuals with hypothyrodism

## Overview
Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) is a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain crucial hormones. Hypothyroidism may not cause
noticeable symptoms in the early stages. Over time, untreated hypothyroidism can cause a number of health problems, such as obesity, joint pain, infertility and heart
disease. Accurate thyroid function tests are available to diagnose hypothyroidism. Treatment with synthetic thyroid hormone is usually simple, safe and effective once
you and your doctor find the right dose for you.

## Project being tackled
Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. The aim of this project test different
classifier models that can determine whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

## Metrics of success
**Precision**: It is used to measures the classifier exactness. It is also known as positive predictive value (PPV).
**Recall**: It measures the classifier completeness. It is also known as sensitivity or hit rate, or true positive rate (TPR). Specificity: It measures the proportion
of actual negatives that are correctly identified and also called a true negative rate (TNR).
**Accuracy**: It measures the fraction of predictions our model got right.  It can be calculated as the total number of correct predictions divided by the total number of test cases.
**F1-Score**: It measures the balance between precision and recall.
**Class weighted accuracy**: It can be calculated as the ratio of the sum of each class size multiplied by its individual accuracy to the total number of test cases.
