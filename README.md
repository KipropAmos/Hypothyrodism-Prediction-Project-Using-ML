# Using machine learning to predict individuals with hypothyrodism

This project deals with the classification of patient whether he or she has hypothyrodism or not
Random forest classifier, Graideint boosting classifier, Ada Boost Classifier and Support Vector machine classifier using different 
kernels have been used with an aim of coming up with a model that can perform the best prediction
Exploratory data analysis has also been performed to build up to a conclusion
